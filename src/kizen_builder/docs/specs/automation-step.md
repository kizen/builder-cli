# Spec shape: single automation step (`steps edit` / `steps add`)

For surgically changing **one** step on an existing automation, without
re-sending the whole `AutomationDef`. Step keys come from
`kizen automations show <api>` and **re-synthesize after every apply** — re-run
`show` before each step operation.

**Consumed by:**
- `kizen automations steps edit <api> <key> --spec-file <f>` — a **patch**.
- `kizen automations steps add <api> (--parent <key>|--root) [--branch yes|no] [--leaf] --spec-file <f>` — a **new step**.

See `automation.md` for step types, config blocks, and graph rules — the
building blocks are identical; only the delivery differs.

## `steps edit` — patch one step

Top-level keys in the JSON **replace** the step's keys. A config block
(`action_*` / `step_*`) is replaced **wholesale**, so start from the current
wire JSON and modify:

```bash
kizen automations steps get flag_big_north_accounts flag > step.json
# …edit step.json…
kizen automations steps edit flag_big_north_accounts flag --spec-file step.json --dry-run
```

```json
{
  "action_change_field_value": {
    "field_ref": "accounts.account_flagged",
    "specific_field_value": false
  }
}
```

- `key` and `type` are **immutable**.
- Re-parenting via `parent_key` / `parent_yes_no` **is** allowed and
  graph-validated.
- Config blocks accept the same authoring shapes as create specs — `field_ref`
  resolves against the live env.

## `steps add` — insert one step

The spec is a **single step** (`step_type` + its config block; `field_ref`
welcome). **Placement comes from the flags, not the spec:**

- `--parent <key>` — attach under that step (or `--root` to become the new first step).
- `--branch yes|no` — required when the parent is a `condition`/`goal`.
- `--leaf` — append as a leaf; **without it, the parent's existing children move
  under the new step** (the default "insert into the chain" behavior).

```json
{ "step_type": "delay", "step_delay": { "days": 1 } }
```

```bash
kizen automations steps add flag_big_north_accounts --parent check --branch yes \
  --spec-file delay.json --dry-run
```

## Gotchas

- **Re-run `automations show` before every step op** — keys rotate after each apply.
- **`steps remove <key> [--cascade]`** removes one step (or the whole subtree).
- The post-apply output includes a before/after semantic diff — that's the audit trail.

# How step editing actually works

**There is no per-step endpoint.** Every `kizen automations steps …` verb runs
the same loop:

GET → translate to write dialect → mutate one node in memory → graph-validate →
atomic PUT (with `last_revision`, so a concurrent edit fails loudly) → re-GET →
report the before/after semantic diff as evidence.

```bash
kizen automations show <name>                # step tree with synthesized keys (the handles)
kizen automations steps get <name> <key>     # one step's wire JSON — the starting point for an edit
kizen automations steps edit <name> <key> [--spec-file|stdin]
kizen automations steps add <name> --parent <key> [--branch yes|no] [--leaf] [--root]
kizen automations steps remove <name> <key> [--cascade]
kizen automations roundtrip <name> [--execute]   # translator fidelity check
```

Consequences worth knowing:

- **Keys re-synthesize after every apply** — they encode order + type, so an
  insert or remove mid-graph renames every later step. Always re-run `show`
  before the next step operation.
- **`edit` is a merge patch, but config blocks replace wholesale.** Send a
  complete config block, not a partial one.
- **`add` inserts into the chain by default** — the parent's children move under
  the new step. `--leaf` appends without adopting them, `--branch yes|no` targets
  a condition/goal branch, `--root` puts the new step first.
- **`remove` splices:** children adopt the removed step's parent and inherit its
  branch position, and `go_to` references retarget to that parent. Removing a
  condition or goal that has children requires `--cascade`, which deletes the
  whole subtree.
- **The post-apply diff is positional**, so a mid-graph change shows up as
  every later step shifting. Verify structure with `show` and treat the diff as
  the audit trail, not as a minimal changeset.
- **Step/trigger `id`s survive editing** — every verb echoes back the `id` it
  read from GET for every step/trigger, including the ones it isn't touching,
  so nothing outside the automation that stored a step UUID breaks, and
  Kizen's own execution-history view keeps showing history against the same
  steps (confirmed live 2026-08-10) instead of marking them deleted. Only the
  synthesized `key`s rotate — `go_to` references are re-keyed onto those, same
  as before.
