# Filters — one DSL, six surfaces

Kizen filters show up in six unrelated-looking places, and they are all the
same structure underneath. Learn it once here; each surface doc only records
which key holds it.

There are **two layers**, and knowing which one you're writing prevents most
filter bugs:

| layer | what it is | where you write it |
|---|---|---|
| **The DSL** | `{"all"\|"any": [{field, op, value}]}` — friendly, field api_names, option *labels* | `--filter` / `--filter-file`, and `filter_config` in a spec file |
| **The wire** | `{"and", "query": [...], "invalid"}` — query groups, `"custom"::<uuid>` field refs, option UUIDs | what Kizen stores; what you get back from a read |

The CLI resolves the DSL to the wire form against live schema at plan time.
Read a filter back and you get the wire form — so a filter copied out of a live
read is *already* wire-shaped and should be passed through as a raw dict, not
re-run through the DSL.

## Where filters appear

| surface | the key | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `records list --filter` | search body `query` | `kizen docs show records` |
| Filter groups (segments) | `config` | `kizen docs show saved-views` |
| Quick filters | `filters` | same shape as filter groups |
| Automation `condition` step | `step_condition.filter_config` | `kizen docs show automation` |
| Automation `search_records` step | `filter_config` | resolved against the step's **own** `custom_object`, not the automation's `target_object` |
| Dashlets | `config.custom_filters` | an empty filter is a specific literal, not `{}` — `kizen docs show dashboard` |

## The DSL

```json
{ "all": [
    { "field": "account_region", "op": "is_any_of", "value": ["North", "West"] },
    { "field": "account_seats",  "op": ">=",        "value": 10 }
] }
```

- Top level is `{"all": [...]}` (AND) or `{"any": [...]}` (OR).
- `field` is the **bare field api_name**. Option labels are resolved to UUIDs
  against the target object for you.
- **Ops are per field type.** Dropdown/status use `is_any_of`/`not_any_of`,
  numbers use `>=`/`between`, text uses `contains`/`starts_with`. There is
  **no `in` and no `gte`**. Run `kizen filters ops [<field_type>]` for the
  authoritative list per type — that command is generated from the same table
  the resolver uses, so it can't drift.
- **A single condition must still be wrapped** in `{"all": [...]}`. A bare
  `{"field": ...}` is not accepted anywhere — not in `--filter`, not in a
  condition step.
- For clause types the DSL doesn't cover (variable comparisons, below), pass a
  raw wire dict instead.

## The wire format

```json
{
  "and": true,
  "query": [
    { "id": "query-0", "and": true, "filters": [
        { "type": "fields_v2", "field": "\"custom\"::<field-uuid>",
          "subtype": "custom", "condition": "is_blank", "value": false },
        { "type": "fields_v2", "field": "\"custom\"::<another-uuid>",
          "subtype": "custom", "condition": "is_any_of",
          "value": ["<option-uuid-1>", "<option-uuid-2>"] } ] },
    { "id": "query-1", "and": false, "filters": [
        { "type": "fields", "field": "display_name",
          "subtype": "non_custom", "condition": "=", "value": "some text" } ] }
  ],
  "invalid": false
}
```

Rules:

- Top level is exactly `{and, query, invalid}`.
- Each query group is `{id, and, filters[]}`. **`id` is required** and
  conventionally `"query-0"`, `"query-1"`, … `and: true` means AND *within* the
  group, `and: false` means OR within it.
- Multiple query groups are ANDed together when the top-level `"and": true`.
- **Custom fields:** `type: "fields_v2"`, `field: '"custom"::<uuid>'`,
  `subtype: "custom"`.
- **Non-custom / system fields:** `type: "fields"`, `field: "<api_name>"`,
  `subtype: "non_custom"`.
- **`value` may never be null** — use `false` for a blank check, `""` for an
  empty-text check.

### Record-field operators

| operator | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `is_blank` | `true` | field is empty |
| `is_blank` | `false` | field has a value |
| `=` | `"<string>"` | equals |
| `>` | `"<ISO date>"` | later than (dates) |
| `is_any_of` | `["<uuid>", …]` | option is one of (choice fields) |

**There is only one blank-check token for record fields — `is_blank`,
distinguished by its boolean value.** There is no separate `is_not_blank` here.
This matches what the records-search UI itself sends and what the CLI's own DSL
emits.

A legacy dashlet-filter helper once emitted a distinct `is_not_blank` token for
"has a value", and that was confirmed working against dashlets at the time — so
Kizen may accept both spellings for `fields_v2`. It is not what the modern UI
or this CLI produce; treat `is_not_blank` on a *record field* as
legacy/unconfirmed and use `is_blank` + `false`.

Do not confuse that with the genuinely distinct `is_not_blank` token used by
**variable** conditions, immediately below — a different clause type with a
different token set.

## Variable-comparison clauses (automations only)

Comparing an automation variable to a static value is a different `type`, and
the DSL doesn't cover it — write the raw dict:

```json
{
  "type": "variable",
  "subtype": "automation_variable",
  "lhs_variable_name": "<variable_name>",
  "condition": "<=",
  "rhs_value": "5.5",
  "rhs_value_type": "static",
  "description": "Variable Value '<variable_name>' Less Than Or Equal To Static Value 5.5",
  "view_model": [
    ["filter_type", { "vars": [
        ["fields_settings_search", true],
        ["custom_object_id", "<object-uuid>"],
        ["object_type", "standard"],
        ["client_tag_field_id", "257bb114-1b86-4761-99bd-95292de23f46"]
      ], "filter_type": "variable" }],
    ["lhs_variable", { "name": "<variable_name>", "data_type": "number" }],
    ["condition", "less_than_or_equal_to"],
    ["value_type", "static"],
    ["value", "5.5"]
  ]
}
```

**`view_model` is required.** Without it the condition block appears
empty/untyped in the Kizen UI editor — it still *executes* correctly via API,
so this fails silently in the direction that matters least and most annoyingly.

Operator mapping (the `condition` key vs its `view_model` string):

| API `condition` | `view_model` string | label |
|---|---|---|
| `<=` | `less_than_or_equal_to` | Less Than Or Equal To |
| `>=` | `greater_than_or_equal_to` | Greater Than Or Equal To |
| `<` | `less_than` | Less Than |
| `>` | `greater_than` | Greater Than |
| `=` | `equal_to` | Equal To |

For a blank check **on a variable**, `condition` is `is_blank` or
`is_not_blank` — a distinct pair of tokens from the record-field
`is_blank`+boolean form above, confirmed from real captured GET responses. Here
`view_model`'s `["condition", …]` entry uses that same string rather than the
`less_than`-style mapping.

`rhs_value` is always a string. `client_tag_field_id`
(`257bb114-1b86-4761-99bd-95292de23f46`) appears to be a constant across
environments. `custom_object_id` is the automation's target object.

## Writing a condition step's filter, start to finish

1. `kizen objects get <object>` — field UUIDs are shown inline for every field,
   and every choice/status/yesnomaybe field's `options` array carries
   `{id, name, code}`. **No separate API call is needed for option UUIDs.**
2. Build the filter. Prefer the DSL and let the CLI resolve it; drop to the
   wire form only for variable clauses.
3. The planner sets `action_on_failure: notify_pause` for you — a condition
   step is rejected with 400 without it.
4. Wire the branches: each child step sets `parent_key` to the condition's key
   plus `parent_branch: "yes"` or `"no"`.
