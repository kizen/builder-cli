"""Resolution of the packaged documentation tree.

The docs ship *inside* the package (``src/kizen_builder/docs/``) rather than at
the repo root, and are served by ``kizen docs show`` rather than copied into
each environment folder. That is what lets the CLI be installed as a wheel:
there is no checkout to resolve paths against, and the docs an agent reads
always match the installed version.

This module is the single chokepoint for finding them. It deliberately raises
``DocsUnavailable`` rather than degrading quietly — a missing docs tree means
the package was built without its ``package-data``, which is a packaging bug
that must be loud.
