      on the automation's own `target_object`) or `variable`.

      ref, like any other field_ref, or a raw field UUID) *together with* a
      relationship hop naming the field on `target_object` that points at
      that related object. The hop can be given explicitly via
      `relationship_field_ref`/`relationship_field_id` (same convenience
      alias pattern as `modify_related_entities`), or left unset to
      auto-detect it when exactly one such relationship field exists.

      confirmed wire dialect repurposes `field` as the hop whenever
      `related_object_field` is present) but `relationship_field_ref` reads
      clearer — see automation.md's "LLM & extraction destinations" section
